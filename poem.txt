Whispers of Time

In the quiet hum of the evening light,
Dreams take flight in the soft moonlight.
Shadows dance on the walls of the sky,
As stars gently whisper a lullaby.

Each moment flows like a river's stream,
Carrying hope, and a hidden dream.
Time ticks by, both fast and slow,
A fleeting breath in its endless flow.

So cherish the seconds, the minutes, the days,
For they are the gems in lifeâ€™s winding maze.
And in the whispers of time, we find,
The beauty of moments, forever entwined.

That's all I can think of
