Another Whisper

In the stillness of a fading day,
Whispers linger, soft and gray.
Each breath of wind tells a tale,
Of distant shores and hidden trails.

Leaves rustle secrets, ancient and wise,
While twilight paints the evening skies.
With every star that begins to gleam,
Hope rekindles the lost dream.

So listen close to the night’s embrace,
For in the silence, you’ll find your place.
Another whisper, a gentle guide,
Leading your heart where dreams reside.

That's all I can think of 

The End. 

Last Whisper
